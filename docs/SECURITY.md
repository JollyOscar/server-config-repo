### Private Disclosure

- **Email**: Create an issue in this repository with the `security` label
- **Contact**: @JollyOscar
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 48 hours

### What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fixes (if any)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

This repository contains network infrastructure configurations. Please follow these guidelines:

### For Contributors
- Review all configuration changes for security implications
- Ensure no sensitive information (passwords, keys) is committed
- Test configurations in isolated environments first
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### For Users
- **Never deploy configurations directly to production** without thorough testing
- Replace all placeholder values with your actual configuration
- Regularly update and patch your systems
- Monitor logs and security alerts
- Use strong authentication methods

## üîß Configuration Security

### Default Security Measures
This repository implements several security measures by default:

- **SSH Hardening**: Key-only authentication, custom port, connection limits
- **Firewall**: Default-deny policy with explicit allow rules and rate limiting  
- **DNS**: Query restrictions and transfer protections
- **System**: Kernel hardening parameters and security monitoring

### Known Limitations
- Configurations use example/placeholder values that **must** be customized
- Some security features require additional setup (certificates, monitoring)
- Regular security updates and maintenance are required

## üìã Security Checklist

Before deploying these configurations:

- [ ] Replace all placeholder values (domains, IPs, usernames)
- [ ] Generate and install proper SSH keys
- [ ] Customize firewall rules for your network topology
- [ ] Set up proper DNS zone files for your domain
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Test all services in isolation
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document your customizations

## üö® Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Isolate** affected systems immediately
2. **Document** the incident with timestamps
3. **Analyze** logs and system state
4. **Report** the incident through appropriate channels
5. **Remediate** vulnerabilities
6. **Review** and update security measures

## üìä Security Monitoring

Regular security activities should include:

- Review of firewall logs and blocked connections
- Analysis of SSH authentication attempts
- DNS query pattern analysis
- System integrity checks (AIDE)
- Security update reviews
- Configuration drift detection

## üîÑ Updates and Patches

This repository's security considerations:

- **Dependencies**: Keep all system packages updated
- **Configurations**: Review configurations when updating services
- **Security Tools**: Update security tools (fail2ban, AIDE) regularly
- **Monitoring**: Review and update monitoring rules
